        <p>
          Cookies are small text files which a website may install on your
          computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. A Cookie
          will help the website, or another website, to recognize your device the
          next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the
          same thing. We use the term &quot;Cookies&quot; in this policy to refer to all
          files that collect information in this way.
        </p>

          There are many functions Cookies serve. For example, they can help us
          to remember your preferences, analyze how well our website is
          performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be
          most relevant to you.

          Certain Cookies contain Personal Information &ndash; for example, if you
          click to &quot;remember me&quot; when logging in, a cookie will store your
          username.
