## 6. Build & Upload Steps (Xcode on Mac)

### Prerequisites
- macOS with latest Xcode installed
- Apple Developer account signed in to Xcode
- Node.js installed

### Step 1: Build the Web App
```bash
cd rnht-platform
npm install
npx next build
```
This generates the static `out/` directory.

### Step 2: Sync to iOS
```bash
npx cap sync ios
```
This copies the web build into the iOS native project.

### Step 3: Open in Xcode
```bash
npx cap open ios
```
Or manually open: `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`

> **IMPORTANT:** Open the `.xcworkspace` file, NOT the `.xcodeproj` file.

### Step 4: Configure Signing
1. Select the **App** target in the project navigator
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab

   - **Version:** `1.0.0`
   - **Build:** `1` (increment for each upload)

### Step 6: Select Device
1. In the toolbar, select **Any iOS Device (arm64)** as the build target
   - Do NOT select a simulator — you need a real device build for archiving

### Step 7: Archive
1. **Product** > **Archive** (menu bar)
2. Wait for the build to complete (may take a few minutes)
3. The Organizer window opens automatically

### Step 8: Upload to App Store Connect
1. In Organizer, select your archive
2. Click **Distribute App**
3. Select **App Store Connect**
4. Select **Upload**
5. Keep default options (Strip Swift symbols, Upload symbols)
6. Click **Upload**
